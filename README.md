This is the approach I took to address this challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Got more initimate with Flexbox as I used it as never before. Getting more mastery over this CSS Layout, still room for more growth...

### Continued development

With this challange done, I finally feel like I have a firm grip on Responsive design. I struggled for months but now I realize the only way to truly learn and understand is through practice. I will only get better from here on out. Its truly euphoric to see my growth. LIVE!

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) - This site really helped me out more than anything else I found online. It explained Gradients so well that I finally solved the problem that was holding me back from finishing this challenge for weeks (mostly because I kept putting it off). It's a fantastic place to learn not just CSS but everything about web development. Definitely give it a visit!
